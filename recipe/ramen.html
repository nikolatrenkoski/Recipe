        <li>1/2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the oil, garlic, and ginger to a small sauce pot and sauté over medium for about one minute.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté for about a minute more.</li>
        <li>Add the broth and water, and bring to a boil.</li>

        <li>Transfer the soup to one or two bowls, then top with sriracha and sliced green onion.</li>
    </ol>
